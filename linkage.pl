TEMPL::OutputWithHeader("TUTORIAL: LINKAGES", <<EOT

<p>In this tutorial, we will sketch various linkages, and use SolveSpace's
geometric constraint solver to simulate their motion. A linkage will
consist of at least two parts, constrained to move with respect to each
other in some particular way. For example, a two-dimensional linkage
may consist of long rigid bars, connected with pin joints at their
endpoints. Two bars result in simple circular motion, and three in a
rigid truss; so interesting linkages of this form will generally consist
of at least four bars.</p>

<p>These linkages are difficult to analyze without a computer. Various
general closed form results do exist, but nothing particularly useful.
It's easier to let the geometric constraint solver find the solution. By
modeling the linkage in this manner, we also can constrain 3d parts
against the skeleton of the linkage, and animate the motion of the
actual space-filling parts, for example to check for interferences as
the linkage is worked.</p>

<p>Here, we will model one of Theo Jansen's linkages for simulated walking
motion. It appears as below:</p>

<div class="forimg">
    <img src="pics/linkage-view.png">
</div>

<p>The pink plate is held stationary. The mechanism is driven at the blue
link, by the green motor (barely visible behind the pink plate). As the
blue link is rotated, the bottom of the grey leg traces the curve in cyan.
</p>

<p>To model the linkage, we start with an empty sketch. In that sketch,
we will draw and constrain a skeleton of the linkage. A link corresponds
to a line segment constrained to a specified length, and a pin joint
corresponds to a point-coincident constraint in 2d. (SolveSpace can also
sketch in 3d, where that point-coincident constraint would correspond
to a ball joint, not a pin joint; but this is a planar linkage, so it's
easier to draw in a 2d workplane.) By dragging a link with the mouse,
we will be able to work the linkage, analogously to if we applied a
displacement at that point in real life, and use various tools to record
the resulting motion.<p>

<p>A dimensioned drawing of that skeleton appears as below:</p>

<div class="forimg">
    <img src="pics/linkage-dimensioned.png">
</div>

<p>It's an eight-bar linkage (since it consists of eight
independently-moving parts); but since the joints on some of those
parts don't all lie in a straight line, the sketch consists of more than
eight lines, in some cases with a truss structure to provide the extra
joint. In the picture, I've marked links that will end up moving as a
rigid body in the same color.</p>

<p>To sketch the linkage, we just sketch and dimension those lines
as usual.  It's helpful to sketch the lines as close as possible to the
desired final geometry; it may be possible to assemble the links in a
configuration that's different from the desired linkage, and this helps
the solver find the intended solution.

<p>First, we sketch the lines, using Sketch &rarr; Line Segment
(or keyboard shortcut S, or the corresponding toolbar icon). We can
insert some of the point-coincident constraints that join the lines
at the endpoints automatically, by clicking an existing endpoint while
creating our new line; we also could create them explicitly if desired,
by selecting the two endpoints and choosing Constrain &rarr; On Point
/ Curve / Plane. It's helpful to constrain the length of one of the
lines before drawing the rest of them, to help get the sketch on the
approximately correct scale, and minimize how much it will change when
it gets dimensioned.</p>

<div class="forimg">
    <img src="pics/linkage-lines.png">
</div>

<p>Then, we insert line length constraints for each link, by hovering
the mouse over a link (so that it turns yellow), clicking (so that it
turns red), and then choosing Constrain &rarr; Distance / Diameter. We
double-click each dimension on the sketch, and type in the desired length.

<div class="forimg">
    <img src="pics/linkage-constrained.png">
</div>

<p>We also constrain the fixed links (drawn earlier in green), by
constraining the left end of the horizontal link to lie at the origin
(Constrain &rarr; On Point / Curve / Plane), and constraining the
orientations of the two links (Constrain &rarr; Horizontal or Vertical).
This fully constrains the linkage; we should therefore have only one
degree of freedom, corresponding to the rotation of our driving link. We
can confirm this by clicking the home link at the top left of the text
browser window, and then clicking the name of the group in which we're
sketching, the default "g002-sketch-in-plane".

<div class="forimg">
    <img src="pics/linkage-dof.png">
</div>

<p>We can now work the linkage, by dragging a link with the mouse. The
solver should generally follow the motion of the mouse. In some cases,
the solver may fail and indicate an error, by turning the background
of the sketch from black to dark red. This may arise from numerical
problems in the solver, in which case we may be able to operate the
linkage correctly by dragging slower. It may also arise from a real
problem with the linkage; the solver will fail at the same points where
a real linkage would bind. In that case, the linkage must be redesigned,
or driven from a different link. In any case, the error may be cleared
by choosing Edit &rarr; Undo.</p>

<p>We also can work the linkage with a dimension. For example, we can add
a constraint on the angle of the driven link with respect to the long
horizontal link, which corresponds to the rotation of the motor or other
actuator driving the linkage.</p>

<div class="forimg">
    <img src="pics/linkage-angle.png">
</div>

<p>The sketch is now fully constrained, with 0 DOF. To trace the
operation of the linkage systematically, we can step that dimension. To
do so, we click the dimension (so that it turns red), and then choose
Analyze &rarr; Step Dimension. The starting angle is determined by that
dimension's current value, and we can specify the final angle arbitrarily,
by clicking "change" in the text browser window and typing it in, and
then hitting Enter. We can likewise specify the number of steps; if we
step from 40 degrees to 50 degrees in 20 steps, for example, the solver
will move the dimension to 40.5 degrees, then 41, 41.5, 42, ... until
it reaches the final value of 50. If we want to watch the linkage move,
then we should probably increase that step count, because the solver
will otherwise work too quickly for us to see it animate.</p>

<div class="forimg">
    <img src="pics/linkage-step-dim.png">
</div>

<p>We also can record the position of a point on the linkage as the
linkage moves. To do so, we click a point (so that it turns red), and
then choose Analyze &rarr; Trace Point. Any motion of that point will now
be recorded with a cyan curve.</p>

<div class="forimg">
    <img src="pics/linkage-trace.png">
</div>

<p>To stop tracing, we choose Analyze &rarr; Stop Tracing. A file dialog
will appear; we can dismiss that by pressing Escape or choosing cancel,
or we can specify a .csv file, into which the points on that trace will
be exported, in the model's global (x, y, z) coordinate system. The
spacing of those points will be determined by the sequence of positions
at which the linkage was solved. If the linkage was worked "by hand",
by dragging a link with the mouse, then that spacing will be arbitrary;
the geometric curve traced is meaningful, but the speed along that
curve is not. Here, for example, the linkage was worked with the mouse,
and we then plotted the output point's x as a function of y (in Scilab;
but many programs could do this, for example most spreadsheets).</p>

<div class="forimg">
    <img src="pics/linkage-graph-geo.png">
</div>

<p>If the linkage was worked with Step Dimension, then that speed is
known, and this file may be used to plot output position as a function of
link angle. Here, for example, the linkage was worked over a half rotation
with Step Dimension, and we plot the change in x (the blue trace) and y
(the black trace) as a function of time or, equivalently, angle.</p>

<div class="forimg">
    <img src="pics/linkage-graph-speed.png">
</div>

<p>Once the skeleton of the linkage exists, solid models may be
constrained against it. This is how the picture at the beginning of this
tutorial was generated. If those constraints are chosen appropriately,
then the solid models will follow the skeleton of the linkage as the
linkage is worked. For a planar linkage, for example, a good choice
of constraints is:</p>

<ul>
<li>linked part's z-axis normal parallel to our reference z-axis normal,
to hold the linked part in a plane parallel to our linkage plane;</li>
<li>a point from linked part lies in specified workplane (or on specified
plane face from solid model), to hold the linked part at the desired
translation normal to the plane;</li>
<li>point-on-point, in 2d (choose a workplane parallel to the linkage plane,
and choose Sketch &rarr; In Workplane; then select the two points, and
choose Constrain &rarr; On Point), at one of the pin joints; and</li>
<li>a line in the solid model parallel to the line in the skeleton of the
linkage, also in 2d.</li>
</ul>

<p>Other combinations of constraints may work, but must be chosen
carefully to avoid ambiguity as the linkage moves. To operate the linkage,
it's necessary to drag the entities in that original skeleton; this may
become difficult as the model becomes crowded with entities from the solid
models, since those are easy to instead select by accident. To avoid this,
we can hide the entities from those solid models (while leaving the solid
model itself visible), by clicking the home link at the top left of the
text browser window, and un-checking the "shown" box for those groups.</p>

<p>We can also draw a "handle" on the linkage, to extend the driven link
and make it easier to grab with the mouse. Here, for example, we do that
with an additional line, sharing an endpoint with the driven link and
constrained parallel to it. The handle is assigned to a custom line style,
so that we can mark it in blue, and hide it in any exported file.</p>

<div class="forimg">
    <img src="pics/linkage-handle.png">
</div>

<p>The linkage drawn above used only pin joints. Other kinds of joints
may be modeled, using different constraints. For example, a pin that
slides in a slot may be modeled as a point-on-line constraint. That
constraint is used here, to model a Whitworth quick-return mechanism:

<div class="forimg">
    <img src="pics/linkage-whitworth.png">
</div>

<p>This mechanism contains rotating links: one 15 mm long, about the
origin, and one 80 mm long, about a point 30 mm below the origin. As
usual, the pin joint for the rotating link in 2d constrains two of
the link's three degrees of freedom, leaving it with only rotation
about the pinned joint.</p>

<p>It also contains two pins in slots, corresponding to the two
point-on-line constraints, drawn here as square magenta boxes. These
joints constrain only one degree of freedom, leaving the link free both
to rotate about the constrained point, and to translate along the line.
Finally, the 40 mm link is constrained horizontal, and 35 mm above the x
axis. This corresponds to a linear guide, which constrains two degrees
of freedom, leaving the link with only translation in the constrained
direction.</p>

<p>As before, we can constrain solid models against the skeleton, and
they will follow the motion of the mechanism.</p>

<div class="forimg">
    <img src="pics/linkage-whitworth-solid.png">
</div>

<p>Here, we've once again provided a handle to aid in working the linkage,
drawn in blue. The same tools may be used to analyze this linkage as
before; everything moves in lines or arcs, so the geometric trace isn't
particularly interesting, but the speed of the quick return mechanism,
for example, can be measured and graphed, using Analyze &rarr; Trace Point
on the output point and then Analyze &rarr; Step Dimension to work the
linkage, and finally Analyze &rarr; Stop Tracing to save the results.</p>

<div class="forimg">
    <img src="pics/linkage-whitworth-graph.png">
</div>

<p>The "quick return" feature is visible here, as the output position
increases slowly and then decreases quickly.</p>

<p>Other mechanisms with linear slides may have more interesting geometric
behavior. For example, we can model an elliptical trammel by constraining
two points on a line to lie on the x and y axes. Any other point on that
line will trace out an axis-aligned ellipse:
